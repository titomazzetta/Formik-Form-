# Formik Login Form

This is a simple login form implemented using React and Formik library. The form allows users to enter their email and password and submit the form for authentication.

## Features

1. **Input Validation**: The form performs validation on the user inputs to ensure that the email and password fields are not empty and meet certain criteria.

2. **Email Validation**: The email field is validated to ensure that it follows the standard email format (e.g., `example@example.com`).

3. **Error Handling**: If any validation errors occur, appropriate error messages are displayed below the corresponding input fields.

4. **Form Submission**: Upon successful validation, the form can be submitted. The `onSubmit` function is called, which currently displays an alert with the message "Login Successful". You can modify this function to handle the form submission according to your specific requirements, such as making an API call to authenticate the user.

5. **Form State Management**: The form state is managed using Formik, a popular form library for React. It simplifies form handling by managing the form's state, validation, and submission.

6. **Initial Values**: The initial values for the email and password fields are set to empty strings, as defined in the `initialValues` object.

7. **Form Field Binding**: The `formik.handleChange` function is used to bind the input fields to the formik state. This allows for easy synchronization between the input values and the form state.

8. **Error Display**: The error messages are conditionally rendered below each input field based on the validation errors returned by the `validate` function.

9. **Submit Button**: Clicking the "Submit" button triggers the form submission. The button is disabled until the form is valid.

10. **Accessibility**: The form includes appropriate `htmlFor` attributes for the labels and uses semantic HTML elements to ensure accessibility best practices.
